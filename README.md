# BWT Mobile Friendly Sass

A project that incoporates Sass into this project. Broken down in several directories: **completed**, **follow-along**, and **fresh**.
Each folder plays a different role in the project. It is up to you for preference.

## Directories Included

### Follow Along (follow-along)

This directory is for class instruction. It will only have starter files and compile bundler plugged in.

### Completed (completed)

This directory will already have the completed code for project we do in class, `follow-along`. \* _*THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT COMPLETED WILL LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME AS FOLLOW ALONG CODE*_ \*

### Fresh (fresh)

This directory only has the starter index file and css folder - DOES NOT include package.json file for bundling.

## Getting Started

- Includes:
  - Boilerplate code
  - (Font Awesome - Free Tier)[https://fontawesome.com/] - (Icons)[https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&p=2&m=free]
  - (Sass)[https://sass-lang.com/] - (Docs)[https://sass-lang.com/documentation]
- Requirements:
  - (Yarn)[https://yarnpkg.com/]
  - (Parcel)[https://parceljs.org/] - (Docs)[https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html]

After forking, make sure you're in the base directory of this repository. You will have to do the following commands to install a `package manager` and scripts that will compile your SASS code down to regular CSS.

#### Install packages - (_Parcel_)[https://parceljs.org/] bundling tool:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

After `parcel` has been installed, you will now be able to compile down any future changes in your sass file.

#### Compile Sass

Dev mode

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

Production mode

```bash
$ yarn build
```

**What are the difference between dev and production mode? Dev is for when developing and not ready for live, it watches for any changes. Production building for when the code is ready to be pushed up for live. Builds once.**
